# Education_Website_Frontend_With_Speech_Recognition

This website is a single-page application (SPA), meaning it functions as a single interface and dynamically updates content without full page reloads. This approach enhances user experience.

The website boasts responsive design, ensuring optimal display and interaction across various devices (desktops, mobiles, tablets).

Speech recognition capabilities are powered by the Annyang library, granting users voice control over website features.

The ReactJS framework serves as the foundation for the website's structure and organization.

Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, provides the website's styling.

The website adheres to progressive enhancement principles. It delivers a functional user experience on all browsers. Users on older browsers will not be hindered, although voice control features might be unavailable.

While compatibility with Microsoft Edge is currently under evaluation, the website functions flawlessly on Google Chrome and other major browsers.
